# RoboDesk
Arduino code for LOGICDATA protocol and remote handset hacking for automated standing desk

The `simple` branch contains only button-latching code that listens to the changing display and lets go of the MEM buttons when the display stops changing.

# Warning
This interface probably violates the LOGICDATA warranty.  Note this warning in their literature:

Danger: it is not allowed to connect self constructed products to
LOGICDATA motor controls. To prevent damage of the unit, use only
components suitable for LOGICDATA motor controls.
