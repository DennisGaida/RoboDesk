# RoboDesk
Arduino code for LOGICDATA protocol and remote handset hacking for automated standing desk

This is my attempt to reverse-engineer the LOGICDATA protocol used in devices from www.logicdata.at, and to implement unapproved device extensions to interact with the HS port on their robotic desks.

# Warning
This interface probably violates the LOGICDATA warranty.  Note this warning in their literature:

Danger: it is not allowed to connect self constructed products to
LOGICDATA motor controls. To prevent damage of the unit, use only
components suitable for LOGICDATA motor controls.
